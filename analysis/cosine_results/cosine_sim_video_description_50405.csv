60,7311706941280013610,2023-12-12,"This is the most dangerous city in the United States.   It’s Bessemer, Alabama, found just west of Birmingham, and it has a violent crime rate of 33 per 1,000 residents, almost nine times more than the national average.  The town has a population of 26,000 and presents a blend of everyday life, but it also is home to an eerie abundance of abandoned structures, ranging from historic residences to shopping malls and even football fields. But the town does boast some culinary gems like Bright Star, the oldest restaurant in Alabama serving up renowned snapper and gumbo.  Additionally, Bessemer marks the birthplace of several notable figures. Heisman winner Jameis Winston is from here along with perhaps the most athletically gifted professional athlete of all time, Bo Jackson.

72,7320684994173685035,2024-01-05,"CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister interviews Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who was released from prison after serving eight years over a plot to kill her abusive mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016 and admitted that she convinced her then-boyfriend to stab her mother to death. Blanchard was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare disorder in which a caregiver feigns or exaggerates illness in someone to elicit attention or sympathy. She had spent her childhood and early adulthood believing she suffered from a host of serious ailments, including leukemia, muscular dystrophy and asthma. After the abuse she experienced at the hands of her mother came to light, Blanchard was sentenced to 10 years in prison and released two years early on December 28th. According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, she is expected to remain under parole supervision until June 2025. #cnn ","[(0.4752, 'For Dizzy Gillespie, Queens Was the Place to Be and to Bop'), (0.3698, 'Where Downtown Poets Go to Church to Greet the New Year'), (0.3614, 'Florida Proud Boy Sentenced to 10 Years in Capitol Attack'), (0.3522, 'The Jan. 6 Inquiry Three Years On, and a PepsiCo Boycott in France'), (0.3446, 'Terrorism in Iran Exposes a Vulnerability It Doesn’t Want to Admit'), (0.3368, 'How to Host a Proper English Pub Lunch'), (0.33, 'Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to Idaho’s Strict Abortion Ban'), (0.33, 'Biden Condemns Trump as Dire Threat to Democracy in a Blistering Speech'), (0.3255, 'A One-Sided Affair as Bangladesh’s Ailing Democracy Goes to the Polls'), (0.3213, 'Day 5: The Magic of Losing Yourself in a Task'), (0.3116, 'The Families of Hostages Are Calling on Israel to Do Something Radical'), (0.3063, 'How to Watch the Golden Globes 2024: Date, Time and Streaming'), (0.3012, 'Colorado Police Officer Sentenced to Jail in Elijah McClain Death'), (0.2951, 'In a Land of Primary Colors, Home Is Where the Bounce House Is'), (0.2623, 'A Homeless Man Sleeps in the Lobby of My Apartment Building.

84,7316954481332112671,2023-12-26,"It’s been two years since 5-year-old Summer Wells vanished without a trace from a small town in Tennessee. Drone footage by @Tyler 🎥 On June 15, 2021, Summer’s parents said she was helping her mother and grandmother plant flowers before going inside their Rogersville home to play with her toys.  Then, out of nowhere, Summer vanished. That was the last time her mother said she had seen her daughter. “I yelled downstairs for her a couple of times, and I didn’t get an answer. Which was unusual because usually she always answers me, so I went down there to check and she was nowhere inside, she was just gone,” Summer Wells’ mother Candus Wells said. Her family believes Summer may have been abducted, taken down a steep hill behind the home — possibly to a waiting car along the road. #summerwells #summerwellsmissing #summerwellsupdates #summerwellsmissingupdates #summerwellsupdate #canduswells #drphil #drphilshow  #truecrime #truecrimecommunity #crimetok #murdermystery #murder #murderstory #murdermystery2 #breakingnews #news #complex #latestnews #trending #trendingreels #netflix #documentary #documentaries #serialkiller #serialkillers #fyp #tiktok #fypage #viral #viralvideo #viraltiktok #hulu #trendingvideo #trendingtiktok #missinggirl #drphil #drphilshow #nancygrace #nancygraceonthescene #scary #scarystories #scarytiktoks #scaryvideos #xybca #xyzbcafypシ   #paranormal #paranormalactivity #paranormaltiktok #truestory #storytime #story #conspirancytheory #conspiracy #fyp #fypシ #fypage #creepypasta #creepy #creepyfacts #creepytok #scarystories #scary #scarytiktoks #scarystory #greenscreenvideo #trending #viral #nanygrace  ","[(0.4887, 'The Evening: A Success and a Setback for Ukraine'), (0.4077, 'Sondheim Was a Critical Darling.
