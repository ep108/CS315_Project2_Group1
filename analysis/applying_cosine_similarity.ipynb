His brother did! He played Marc Anthony! But yes, all three Booth brothers (John, Edwin, and Junius) did perform Julius Caesar together in 1864 in order to raise money for a statue of Shakespeare in Central Park that's still standing to this day.  Anyway, real ones know that when he was talking about Caesar, he totally was referring to his more famous brother Edwin just as much as he was Lincoln.  #johnwilkesbooth #abrahamlincoln #americancivilwar #americanhistory #ushistory #historytok #assassinsmusical #theater #shakespeare #edwinbooth #juliuscaesar \n",

      "video_description: #greenscreen Went on a deep dive into the history of the whole Booth family and found out that it resembles something between a Shakespearean tragedy and the 19th century version of The Iron Claw. The father was a super famous actor and the two brothers were basically pitted against each other from childhood to see who would inherit their father's legacy and by 1865 John Wilkes was LOSING. There's a pretty compelling narrative where Lincoln's assassination, while still fueled by John's support for the confederacy and hatred of Lincoln, was also a desperate bid to finally upstage his brother by becoming Brutus rather than just playing him. It  sucks that when comparing the fame of the two brothers today, he succeeded.  #edwinbooth #johnwilkesbooth #abrahamlincoln #americancivilwar #ushistory #americanhistory #historytok #assassinsmusical #theater #hamlet #shakespeare \n",

      "video_description: A New Mexico grand jury has indicted actor Alec Baldwin on charges related to the 2021 fatal shooting on the set of the movie “Rust.” Baldwin is charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. “We look forward to our day in court,” Baldwin’s attorneys Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro told CNN in a statement. Baldwin’s attorney has previously insisted his client is not guilty. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza injured when a gun held by Baldwin fired a live round during a scene rehearsal on the set of the Western. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dropped against Baldwin last year, with prosecutors saying in a statement at the time that they could not “proceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form” due to “new facts” in the case. #CNN #News \n",

It was known throughout the Greek and Hellenistic world. It continued to exist in Roman times, doubtless in a somewhat artificially preserved way.  But Apollo ceased to speak to men as Christianity took hold, just as the other oracles also fell silent: a lot of pagan temples were being destroyed at the time. Christianity was on the rise and the temple of Delphi was one of many to be purposeful.  ib; dirtdiaries_ #prophecy #oracleofdelphi  #delphi #oracleofapollo #oracle #ancientgreece #ancientgreecevibes  #greece #roman #romanempire  #ancienthistory #history #historytime  #historytok  #historybuff #LearnOnTikTok \n",

      "video_description: CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister interviews Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who was released from prison after serving eight years over a plot to kill her abusive mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016 and admitted that she convinced her then-boyfriend to stab her mother to death. Blanchard was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare disorder in which a caregiver feigns or exaggerates illness in someone to elicit attention or sympathy. She had spent her childhood and early adulthood believing she suffered from a host of serious ailments, including leukemia, muscular dystrophy and asthma. After the abuse she experienced at the hands of her mother came to light, Blanchard was sentenced to 10 years in prison and released two years early on December 28th. According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, she is expected to remain under parole supervision until June 2025. #cnn \n",

In this interview he rapped a Nicki Minaj verse, dabbed, claimed several members of Congress are guilty of fraud and said he wasn't a politician 🤔 George Santos was ousted from Congress on the 1st December following an Ethics Committee report that found there was \"substantial evidence\" that he had \"knowingly caused his campaign committee to file false or incomplete reports with the Federal Election Commission; used campaign funds for personal purposes; engaged in fraudulent conduct in connection with RedStone Strategies LLC; and engaged in knowing and willful violations of the Ethics in Government Act as it relates to his Financial Disclosure (FD) Statements filed with the House\". In the report from the Ethics Panel's campaign spreadsheets, it was found that he spent around $6,000 in campaign donations at the luxury brand Ferragamo and Botox injections. It was also reported that campaign funds were used for OnlyFans subscriptions 👀  #ziwe #georgesantos #ziwegeorgesantos #popculture #trending #viral #ziweinterview #uspolitics #usnews #republican \n",
