104,"Visit the new, much larger distiller’s space and sip its new rye, try a red wine that supports prison reform and find a heart-shaped bowl for your Valentine.","New York Distilling Company, one of the oldest craft distilleries in New York City, is moving and introducing a new whiskey. Opened in 2011, this distillery made Williamsburg, Brooklyn, its home until last year. In March it will open a new facility, three times the size of the original, in Bushwick. The new distillery will open for 90-minute tours, with a fee and reservations required, beginning on March 1; it will eventually open a new public cocktail bar and tasting room, but it will not be called the Shanty, as it was in Williamsburg. In addition, it is retiring its longstanding Ragtime Rye and replacing it with Jaywalk. The new rye is distilled from Horton rye, a grain varietal with roots dating back to 17th-century New York that the distillery has nurtured, growing it in the Finger Lakes region, over the past eight years. “This is the rye we have been dreaming of for 13 years,” said Allen Katz, the distillery’s co-founder. Three ryes will be bottled under the Jaywalk label: straight rye, a blend of 6-, 7- and 8-year-old ryes and 92 proof ($50 for 750 milliliters); bonded rye, 100 proof ($55 for 750 milliliters); and heirloom rye, cask strength, so named because it’s made from 100 percent Horton rye ($119 for a 700 milliliters). The new whiskies are robust and complex in their flavor, not merely spicy like many ryes. They will all be available starting Feb. 15 from Bottlerocket, in Manhattan, Brooklyn Wine Exchange and Gnarly Vines, in Brooklyn, and online.
