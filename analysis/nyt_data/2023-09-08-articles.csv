During the following decades, the brand continued to innovate — inventing the minaudière and creating necklaces that could be worn as bracelets — and in 1933 it introduced the Mystery Setting, in which stones appeared to be invisibly placed without any of their metal fasteners showing. Whimsical designs, which gained a loyal following from the likes of Princess Grace of Monaco and Elizabeth Taylor, took cues from the cosmos, flora and fauna, mythology, poetry, ballet, fairy tales, architecture and Surrealism.
