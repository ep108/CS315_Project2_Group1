When not serving dinners, the space houses his events company, MM Kitchen Studio. (Opens March 7, 8, 9) Then there’s Dan Kluger with Greywind, a complex near Hudson Yards that has a restaurant, a bar called Spygold and a bakery that becomes the Chef’s Counter three evenings a month. “I need to be there, but I don’t want to take on too much,” Mr. Kluger said. “The space is also used for private events so I can’t overcommit.” The counter has seats for eight people and offers about six courses with various themes, changing each month, with vegetables and proteins in tandem, $185 at 5:45 and 8:15 p.m. Last week’s menu included leek terrine with potato soup and trout roe, and chicken “oyster” with oyster mushrooms.
