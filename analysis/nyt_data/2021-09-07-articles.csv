Nichanian, 67, is talking about her hair. Throughout her 33-year tenure at Hermès, where she is currently the artistic director of what the brand calls its men’s universe (which encompasses not only the two annual clothing collections but also shoes, accessories and watches), she has maintained its natural shade of glossy chestnut and worn it in a long, layered bob. But recently she has been inspired by the girls she sees walking around the city with vivid neon manes. While Nichanian — who is wearing a crisp white shirt, dark boot-cut jeans and a few pieces of simple silver jewelry — may outwardly embody the tenets of classic Parisian good taste, she has always prized, as she puts it, “people who are one step to the side.”",2021-09-07T11:00:13+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Véronique Nichanian Makes Clothes for the Thinking Man,"Nichanian, Veronique;Hermes International SA;Fashion and Apparel;Paris (France);Men and Boys"
