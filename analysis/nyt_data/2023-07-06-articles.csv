31,Lyn Hejinian’s sonnet proposes that liberation might be found in scattering and disorientation.,"Lyn Hejinian’s poem has the sonnet’s traditional 14 lines and even features the sonnet’s coupletlike resolution, but the length of its lines exceeds tradition, nearly reaching to the very edges of line itself. It borrows prose’s linear momentum but refuses the carelessness of prose’s wraparound ends. The power of these lines is, in part, generated by their quick liftoffs — each begins with a word of a single syllable. This is paired with cunning line breaks that enjamb, suggest, double the words that surround them and intensify the effect of the poem by giving it both vertical and horizontal motion. Throughout, there is thick sound stacked on thick sound, the diction mixed and surprising, the everyday and the erudite sparking like flint and steel. In my reading of the poem, it is as if the line is seeking to enact the poem’s proposition: that in the motion of scattering, in an orientation of disorientation, a possibility of liberation might be found.

Westerly Canteen’s trailer holds a compact kitchen with cream-painted walls and blond wood counters. “I had this wild idea, like, ‘What if we took the food truck concept and put it in a space that is still mobile but feels beautiful and welcoming?’” Levine said as she stirred a pot of golden-hued stock, fragrant with spring onion and green garlic. Levine, who previously worked at the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant Chez Panisse, founded Westerly with her partner, Alex Kaindl, a farmer who tends half an acre in Sharon, Conn. Nearly all of their ingredients are sourced from farms nearby. (Starting this month, Kaindl’s crops will also be incorporated.) Developing the weekly menu is a puzzle that requires maximizing limited space and resources. “A lot of our decisions are very creative and passion driven but also very practical,” Kaindl said as Levine ladled the stock over a plate of nettle-stuffed ravioli. “We slice up the spring onions that go into the dish, and the tops are made into the broth,” Levine said. “We’re using every piece of the onion.” The founders hope to engage the surrounding community while also drawing diners from afar. They’ve partnered with Tenmile Distillery, which offers cocktails made with local ingredients to go alongside Westerly’s menu (their take on a Negroni includes Faccia Brutto bitters from Brooklyn, Method sweet vermouth from Romulus and gin made on-site at Tenmile). “We really want people to sit here and stay a while,” Levine said. westerlycanteen.com.",2023-07-06T13:00:12+0000,article,T Magazine,News,A Hawaii Shop Turning Oahu’s Invasive Trees Into Surfboards,Wood and Wood Products;Surfing;Hawaii
