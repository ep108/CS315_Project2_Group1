0,"In “The Fall,” Wolff predicts the collapse of Rupert Murdoch’s cable network and recounts the recent tumult there through a barrage of fuzzily sourced trash talk.","Michael Wolff’s new book is a chronicle of very recent events that starts with something that hasn’t happened yet: the death of Rupert Murdoch, who as of this writing is 92 and very much alive.
