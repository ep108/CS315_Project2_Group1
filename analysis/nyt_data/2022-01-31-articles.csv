It has a slight mushroom aroma and deserves to be sipped neat. You could call its arrival a return: In the 1890s, Jōkichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist who married an American woman, settled in Chicago and started producing koji-fermented whiskey. After the distillery was destroyed by a fire, he turned to medical research in New York and went on to isolate chemical adrenaline. His success allowed him to donate cherry trees to Washington, D.C., and to establish the Nippon Club in New York. He played a diplomatic role after World War I and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

113,‘The Ucross Cookbook’ provides recipes and testimonials from an artist residency program founded in 1983.,"Ucross, located on a ranch in northeast Wyoming, houses an artist residency program founded in 1983 and has provided inspiration to such figures as the poet and performer Karma Mayet Johnson, the journalist and novelist Suki Kim and the baritone Nathan Gunn, among many others. Their tenures at the ranch were punctuated by meals from the kitchen of Cindy Brooks, who, with Cree LeFavour, a former resident, has now written “The Ucross Cookbook.” (Sales support the nonprofit.) Worth preparing are caramelized carrots with ras-el-hanout; hard winter spinach soup; soba noodles with coconut, chiles and kale; and Powder River meatballs. “Poet’s Lunch” peanut butter cookies were a big hit, and I was delighted to see that someone beside me simmers jasmine rice in jasmine tea.

If he weren’t an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least that’s the sense you get after spending time with his “Slanguage” paintings, which are imbued with messages that aren’t immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take “Yay Area” (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the “Yay” of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Down’s 1993 song “Ice Cream Man,” its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though he’s hardly the only rapper to have used the term).
