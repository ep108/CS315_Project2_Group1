4,Amy O’Rourke works the seafood counter at a busy suburban grocery store. We spent the day with her to see how she gets everything done.,"It’s easy to take the grocery store for granted. After all, there’s nothing particularly remarkable about the mundane task of picking up our weekly bread, fruit and cereal.

In the latest episode of On the Job, we spent the day with Amy O’Rourke at Stew Leonard’s — a grocery chain in the Northeast that goes out of its way to engage and entertain shoppers. Her goal as assistant seafood manager is not only to ensure that customers can find the freshest clams, shrimp and salmon, but also to make a job that can feel invisible, visible. She accomplishes that with an abundance of energy, an uncannily outgoing personality and occasionally, a lobster suit.",2023-12-16T01:47:07+0000,article,Food,News,"How to Serve 35,000 Grocery Shoppers a Week?
