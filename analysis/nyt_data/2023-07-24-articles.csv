19,"What T Magazine’s editors and contributors are bringing to thank their hosts this summer, including surrealistic serving spoons and bubbles to entertain children.","When the French interior designer Camille Vergnes throws a dinner party in Paris, she opts for unfussy white table linens and white plates. This allows her Art Deco-style set of serving spoons, salad servers and carving knives, all with almond green shagreen handles, to take center stage. “I use [the serving set] as the key piece of the table along with the flowers or candleholders,” she says. Vergnes’s approach reflects a shift in focus when it comes to tableware, away from handblown glassware and patterned napkins to sculptural utensils. In Copenhagen, stirred by her homeland’s history of silversmithing, the Danish jeweler Olga Bonne has added delicate hand-wrought silver spoons, forks and knives with handles in the shape of fish, kestrels or hares to her roster of whimsical creations. She takes inspiration from eras past, “when arts and crafts did not have to be functional but most of all ornamental and extravagant,” she says. Some designers are marrying the functional and fanciful: In Brighton, the British designer Alessandra Williams recently launched her namesake homeware label with sets of hand-carved salad servers in green leopard stone and blackened jacaranda wood made by Fair Trade co-operatives in Zimbabwe and Nairobi. Frank Traynor, the United States-based artist behind the Perfect Nothing Catalog, adorns everything from cheese graters to cake knives with copper and tin combined with semiprecious stones and shells, lending quotidian objects new charm. Then there’s the British chef and farmer Ben Bodman, who makes carbon Damascus steel knives with swirling patterns on the blades and myrtlewood and rosewood handles in Melksham, a small town in Wiltshire, England, under the label Bodman Blades.
