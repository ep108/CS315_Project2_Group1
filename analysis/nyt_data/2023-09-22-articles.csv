Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective — Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration — her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. “What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it,” he says. “That’s what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her.”",2023-09-22T09:01:06+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Gael García Bernal and Perla Valtierra on Making Work That Lasts,"Actors and Actresses;Ceramics and Pottery;Content Type: Personal Profile;Garcia Bernal, Gael;Valtierra, Perla;Mexico"
