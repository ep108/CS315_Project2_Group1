95,A pair of charming Gotham-based character comedies are among the highlights of this month’s under-the-radar streaming recommendations.,"“Barbie” is the current commercial and critical triumph of the screenwriting (and real-life) partners Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, and “Frances Ha” is their origin story. But comparatively little ink is spilled these days on their middle feature (which Baumbach directed), a delightfully funny comedy that turns the tropes of the college coming-of-age movie and the Manic Pixie Dream Girl on their heads. Lola Kirke stars as Tracy, a college freshman new to New York City who gets a whirlwind introduction to the city via her soon-to-be-stepsister Brooke (Gerwig). Gerwig and Baumbach’s wise screenplay delicately dramatizes how Brooke first seems like Tracy’s platonic ideal of the young urban woman, then slowly reveals herself as messy in a multitude of ways. Gerwig’s multilayered performance is one of her best, while Baumbach orchestrates the picture’s shifts from character drama to door-slamming farce with bouncy ease.",2023-11-29T16:46:52+0000,article,Movies,News,"‘Mistress America,’ ‘Tramps’ and More Streaming Gems","Movies;Mistress America (Movie);Tramps (Movie);X (Movie);All My Puny Sorrows (Movie);The Zero Theorem (Movie);Love to Love You, Donna Summer (Movie);Wham!
