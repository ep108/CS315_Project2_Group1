Since then, they have added peach stones, oyster shells, the royal blue glass of Saratoga water bottles, petrified wood and deer bones — discovered on Martinez Cohen’s parents’ property in upstate New York — to the mix of marble chips, other stone fragments and cement that is traditionally ground up to make terrazzo, the speckled composite material that has become the pair’s primary medium. Martinez Cohen and Bush combine their unconventional rock substitutes with colored cement or epoxy, forming a slurry that they pour into zinc and brass outlines to create kitschy, expressionistic tableaus. The results suggest Roman mosaics by way of Brooklyn: “Date Palm Tree (Tree of Paradise)” (2018), a 6-by-2-foot composition in a pine frame, depicts a palm tree with a wiggly trunk and faux-naïve fronds from which hang fruits inlaid with sections of real date pits.",2023-09-15T09:00:50+0000,article,T Magazine,News,The Make-Do Joys of Terrazzo,Handicrafts;Design;Rock and Stone;Ceramics and Pottery;Art

61,"In his lifetime, Ernie Barnes was largely dismissed and ignored by the industry.

In 2022, the second of two originals — inspired by a childhood adventure of sneaking into a famed dance hall to watch couples drag and sway to the live performances of Clyde McPhatter or Duke Ellington — came up for auction at Christie’s, selling for $15.3 million. The buyer was the Houston-based energy trader and high-stakes gambler Bill Perkins, 54, who won a bidding war against 22 other prospects. This vast divergence of price belies a convergence of spirit: The countless individuals hanging inexpensive prints on the walls of bedrooms and barbershops share with Perkins (and no doubt with the other wealthy collectors who bid the painting up to more than 76 times its high estimate) an ineluctable desire for the nostalgia and affirmation that Barnes’s work conveys.",2023-09-15T09:00:59+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Millions Saw His Paintings on TV.
