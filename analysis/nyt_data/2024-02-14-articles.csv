They call their tapes “Sweded,” explaining the time it takes to supply films by claiming the copies have to be imported from Scandinavia. In Gondry’s fantasy, the community responds well to this homespun cinema: Not only does demand go up, but store patrons begin to participate in making the movies. Gondry’s theory, he has said, was that “people would enjoy films better if they shot them themselves.”",2024-02-14T10:02:32+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Tubi Is Reviving a Lost Joy: Watching Really, Really Bad Movies","Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming;Social Media;Tubi Inc;Movies"
