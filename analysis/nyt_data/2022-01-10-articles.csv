The tidy eight-ounce square, encased in an edible orange-hued rind, has collected awards over the years, and in the 2021 World Cheese Awards, Prufrock was one of six cheeses from five countries to win gold in the general washed-rind category. It also won recognition at the first New York International Cheese competition, held last summer. The cheese, made from organic milk, has alluring washed rind funkiness, with a scent of dried wildflowers and a yeasty, briny tang on the palate. Eric and Molly Glasgow, the farm’s owners, decided to go poetic with the name instead of giving it a local tie-in. They’ve continued in that vein with most of their other cheeses, including Banneker, their newest, a Cheddar they started making during the pandemic and only sell locally.

To this portfolio it has just added a bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup. The organic syrup, from the Catskills, is given 100 days in the charred white oak barrels used to age its whiskies. The deep amber syrup is thick and scented of earth and smoke, elements that carry into its rich flavor. Alex Clark — who founded the distillery with his wife, Amy Grindeland — is making it as a way to further the life of the bourbon barrels, since according to federal standards, the whiskey must be aged in new barrels.

Eric Bachli, a former brewmaster at Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn, collaborated with Max Nevins, also of Sixpoint Brewery, and Marissa Reiser, a sommelier, to create the aperitif. California brandy adds a kick to the 32 proof drink. Restrained sweetening is provided by organic blue agave syrup from Mexico, and Meyer lemons, mostly from a distillate using the peels, create the lightly bitter citric profile.
