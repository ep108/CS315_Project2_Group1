50,Five new counting books all share one essential strategy: to start a conversation.,"A counting book is tricky to write, for it must inspire readers to do two things at once: to count and to read. The latter task is, of course, what all books must do — create enough intrigue to charm us into turning the page and then turning the next one, and so on until the end. But this going forth page by page, one by one, suggests that counting and reading have something deep in common. After all, we count with numbers and we recount tales. We tell stories and, long ago, shepherds told their sheep, an archaic word for counting members of a group to make sure each one is there. Still, the task of writing a counting book is daunting, for counting is active, whereas listening to a story, especially when we are little and someone else is turning the pages, is passive.",2023-06-09T09:00:48+0000,article,Books,Review,Counting on Conversation,"Books and Literature;Children and Childhood;del Mazo, Margarita;Gravett, Emily;Cali, Davide;How to Count to One: And Dont Even THINK About Bigger Numbers!
