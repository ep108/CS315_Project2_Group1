149,The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on how to contend with the racism in an old children’s book.,"Recently my aunt gifted me my father’s copy of Dr. Seuss’s “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street” so I could read it to my 8-month-old son. The book was one of my father’s favorite books as a child, and he is so pleased to know that it has been passed along to his grandson. It is, I think, the original printing from 1937, has his name written in it and is colored in with crayons and pencils in various places. It was clearly a loved book. But the book also contains an egregious racial stereotype of a Chinese person. (The graphic and text were edited in the 1970s to make them less offensive.) I want to read this book to my son because it was special to my father, but I don’t want to imply that some of the content is OK. I could: get rid of the book; keep the book, but not read it to my son; read it to him but skip over the offensive text and image (I think this could be done without changing the story fairly easily); or read it to him as it is, in its entirety, and have a conversation with him as soon as he is able to understand the issue.",2024-02-02T21:21:54+0000,article,Magazine,News,"If I Read a Vintage Dr. Seuss to My Son, Do I Skip the Racist Part?","Ethics (Personal);Books and Literature;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (Book);Geisel, Theodor Seuss;Children and Childhood;Parenting;Race and Ethnicity;Discrimination;internal-sub-only-nl"
