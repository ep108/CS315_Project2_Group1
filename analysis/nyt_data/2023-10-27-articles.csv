Once you’ve chosen which of the settings and stones to offer your giftee, Prounis will, she says, ask you or the betrothed a series of questions about the couple’s relationship before suggesting a design, which is then etched on the stone by a specialized intaglio carver. Or she’ll present a menu of options — among them, palm trees, clasped hands and olive branches. Prounis’s designs have also included pet portraits, initials and dates. “It’s kind of like an anthropological study of what modern-day people want to inscribe in stone,” she says.
