98,Some of the herbaceous extra-virgin olive oils made in Tuscany are among the best the founder of the Rare Wine Company has tasted.,"Olive oil is made all over Italy, but no region produces oils as singular as those from Tuscany. Mannie Berk, the president of the Rare Wine Company in Brisbane, Calif., is a connoisseur who has had Tuscan extra-virgin olive oils bottled for his company since 1995. Lately, he has found them lacking their customary verve and intensity, a shortcoming he attributes to global warming. But not those made in 2020. He raves about the vintage. Though his company imports 22 different oils, some are worth knowing, like leccino oils by Pruneti, a classic; and Sàgona, more forceful, $59.99 for both. A new oil for his company is the herbaceous Fonte di Foiano 1979 from the Bolgheri region, sold as part of a set of six from areas in and around Chianti for $157.50. Also in that set is the Volpaia from the Classico district, a blend of several olives that’s deep green, minty and viscous with bracing bitterness. The oils, all sold in half-liter bottles, are to use for finishing, not sautéing, to elevate a bowl of pappa al pomodoro or grilled fennel, or to trace over slices of rosemary-scented pork roast.",2021-08-09T19:22:26+0000,article,Food,News,At Least One Thing Good Came Out of 2020,Olive Oil;Rare Wine Co;Tuscany (Italy)

100,"A lower-sodium salt substitute from the Baja Peninsula of Mexico is made with salicornia, a halophyte.","Your salt wardrobe may already include black and pink. But what about green? A new naturally green salt substitute produced from salicornia, a halophyte, has hit the market. Decades ago, José Ramón Noriega planted salicornia on salt-affected farmland in northern Baja California, Mexico. Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. It’s salty enough to use in place of table salt, though it’s substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sautéed fish. That flavor disappears in cake batter or pasta sauce. While Green Salt is more costly than regular kosher or sea salt, it’s comparable in price to many boutique salts.",2021-08-09T19:28:34+0000,article,Food,News,Add Green to Your Salt Lineup,Salt;Cooking and Cookbooks;Mexico

But perhaps more compelling is its coverage of English sparkling wines, a less well-known topic. Climate change has turned the south of England into sparkling wine country, something the French acknowledge onscreen, with admiration; some French producers now own vineyards in England. But whether France is ready to credit England with having discovered champagne before Dom Pérignon’s 17th-century epiphany, a controversy the film examines, or whether James Bond will forgo his Bollinger for Hush Heath Estate, one of the English houses in the film, remains to be seen.",2021-08-09T19:31:55+0000,article,Food,News,Champagne Wishes and Climate Change Dreams,Champagne (Wine);Documentary Films and Programs
