Vuitton’s business was strong enough that in 1888, his only son, Georges, trademarked his now-signature checkerboard Damier print. The company’s steamer bag, which was intended to contain laundry on trans-Atlantic voyages, debuted in 1901; in the 1930s, the brand released the Keepall, a foldable tote, originally made from cotton canvas, that was small enough to be tucked into larger suitcases.",2024-03-12T09:02:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Pharrell and Tyler, the Creator Remix a Classic Tote","Fashion and Apparel;Golf;Luggage and Packing;Williams, Pharrell;Tyler, the Creator;Louis Vuitton"
